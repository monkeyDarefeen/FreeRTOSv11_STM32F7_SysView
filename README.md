# FreeRTOSv11_STM32F7_SysView

After Struggling for a while to use the SystemView from Segger with FreeRTOS, I finally able to do it.
So I created this Empty project, where there are two tasks which only prints some paramters. 
After converting ST-link to J-link, The tasks can be seen in System View, This repo can be used as base repo to start creating any projects with FreeRTOS.
