# FreeRTOSv11_STM32F7_SysView

After Struggling for a while to use the SystemView from Segger with FreeRTOS, I finally able to do it.
So I created this Empty project, where there are two tasks which only prints some paramters. 
After converting ST-link to J-link, The tasks can be seen in System View, This repo can be used as base repo to start creating any projects with FreeRTOS.

The Hardware used:
-Nucleo-32F767ZI
Software Versions:
-FreeRTOS V11.0.1
-SystemView 3.52a
-J-link 7.96a
